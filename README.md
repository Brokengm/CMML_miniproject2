The code for three models and corresponding result data are all provided here. For the detailed modifications in rapid_high_payoff and WSLS models, you can search them by **change:**.  
If you want to run the model, you can just download and run it with Rstudio directly. But be careful about the files path. The input file can be accessed in Week2 miniproject workshop on Blackboard.  
The Q1_visualization.r contains the codes to draw figures comparing rapid, high-payoff model to the origin model. It needs the result files (csv) of two policies as input.  
The Q2_visualization.r contains the codes to draw figures comparing WSLS model to the origin model. It needs the result files (csv) of two policies as input.
